  - `DATABASE_TIMEOUT`: Query timeout in seconds (default: 30)

- **Security Configuration**:
  - `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key for session security
  - `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`: Set to True for production HTTPS environments
  - `PASSWORD_SALT`: Salt for password hashing (if not using environment default)

- **External API Configuration**:
  - `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` and `PLAID_SECRET`: Credentials for Plaid API
  - `PLAID_ENVIRONMENT`: Sandbox or production environment
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI integration

- **Application Behavior**:
  - `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode (should be False in production)
  - `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: List of allowed hostnames for production

Detailed examples of these configuration parameters can be found in the `.env.example` file included with the application source code.

### 7.4 Database Migration

Budget AI supports multiple database platforms and includes tools for migrating between different database systems. This flexibility allows organizations to choose the database platform that best fits their environment and scale requirements.

#### Supported Database Platforms

The application has been tested and verified with the following database systems:

1. **PostgreSQL**: Primary recommended database for production deployments
   - Versions: 12.0 and later
   - Configurations: Neon PostgreSQL (cloud), Google Cloud SQL, and self-hosted

2. **MySQL/MariaDB**: Alternative option for environments with existing MySQL infrastructure
   - Versions: MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.5+
   - Note: Some advanced text search features have reduced functionality

3. **SQLite**: Supported for development and testing environments
   - Version: 3.30 or later
   - Not recommended for production use due to concurrency limitations

The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM abstraction, which provides consistent behavior across different database backends while leveraging platform-specific features where appropriate.

#### Migrating Between Database Platforms

Database migration between platforms (e.g., from Neon PostgreSQL to Google Cloud SQL) involves exporting data from the source database and importing it to the target database. The recommended migration process is as follows:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Create target database instance with appropriate configuration
   - Set up network access between source and target databases
   - Schedule downtime if migrating a production system

2. **Schema Migration**:
   - Use the export_database.py utility to generate schema creation scripts
   - Review and apply schema to target database
   - Verify table structure and constraints

3. **Data Migration**:
   - Export data from source database using export_database.py
   - Import data to target database using appropriate methods
   - Verify row counts and data integrity

4. **Application Configuration**:
   - Update DATABASE_URL in configuration to point to new database
   - Update any database-specific settings
   - Test application connectivity with new database

5. **Validation**:
   - Run application test suite against new database
   - Verify core functionality works as expected
   - Check performance metrics for any significant changes

The export_database.py utility included with Budget AI provides specialized functions for migrating between supported database platforms while preserving data integrity.

### 7.5 Securing Credentials

Protecting sensitive credentials is a critical aspect of Budget AI deployment security. The application handles various types of credentials including database connection strings, API keys, and encryption secrets. This section outlines best practices for securing these credentials across different deployment environments.

#### Credential Management Principles

Budget AI follows these core principles for credential management:

1. **Environment-Based Storage**: Credentials should be stored in environment variables or secure parameter stores, not in code or configuration files.

2. **Least Privilege**: Database users and API accounts should have the minimum permissions necessary for operation.

3. **Credential Rotation**: Support for rotating credentials without application downtime.

4. **Secure Transmission**: Credentials should only be transmitted over encrypted connections.

5. **Audit Logging**: Access to credential management systems should be logged and monitored.

#### Securing Database Credentials

Database credentials are particularly sensitive as they provide direct access to user data. The following practices should be implemented:

- **Use Connection Strings**: Store complete connection strings in environment variables rather than individual components.
  
  ```
  # Recommended
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
  
  # Not recommended
  DB_USER=username
  DB_PASSWORD=password
  DB_HOST=hostname
  DB_PORT=5432
  DB_NAME=database
  ```

- **Connection Pooling**: Configure appropriate connection pooling to avoid repeatedly authenticating to the database.

- **Read-Only Access**: For reporting and analysis purposes, create read-only database users when full write access is not required.

- **Credential Isolation**: Use different database credentials for different environments (development, staging, production).

#### API Key Security

Budget AI integrates with external services like Plaid and OpenAI that require API keys. These keys should be protected using these measures:

- **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables that are accessible only to the application process.

- **Key Restrictions**: When possible, restrict API keys to specific IP addresses or functionality.

- **Separate Development and Production Keys**: Never use production API keys in development environments.

- **Regeneration Procedure**: Document procedures for quickly regenerating API keys if they are compromised.

#### Deployment-Specific Considerations

Different deployment platforms offer varying capabilities for credential management:

- **Render.com Deployment**: Use Render's environment variable feature to securely store credentials. Ensure these are marked as secret values to prevent display in logs.

- **Local Development**: Use .env files for local development but ensure these are excluded from version control with .gitignore.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Use the secret management features of your CI/CD platform to inject credentials during deployment.

By implementing these credential security measures, Budget AI deployments can maintain robust protection for sensitive access keys while enabling necessary functionality.
