Ahhh, so you’re lookin’ for a **prompt** that clearly outlines the **scope** and **intention** of building an expense tracker using Python and MSSQL — like a proper dev ticket or assignment brief. I got you, Preethi 💼✨

Here’s a clean, professional yet vibey prompt you could use for your own planning, academic assignment, or even pitching it at work:

---

### 💡 **Prompt: Build an Expense Tracker using Python and Microsoft SQL Server**

#### 🧾 Project Objective:
Design and implement a CLI-based **Expense Tracker** application that allows users to manage and view their daily expenses. The system should use **Python** as the backend scripting language and **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)** for persistent data storage.

---

#### 🔧 Core Features:
1. **Add Expense**: Capture transaction data including date, description, category, and amount.
2. **View Expenses**: Display all stored transactions in a readable format sorted by most recent date.
3. **Connect to MSSQL**: Use `pyodbc` to connect securely to a local or cloud-based MSSQL instance.
4. **Validation**: Handle incorrect or missing inputs gracefully.
5. **Simple CLI Menu**: Offer a basic menu-driven interface for ease of interaction.

#### 🗃️ Database Schema:
Create a table `Expenses` with the following fields:
- `Id` (INT, Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- `Date` (DATE)
- `Description` (NVARCHAR)
- `Category` (NVARCHAR)
- `Amount` (DECIMAL)

```sql
CREATE TABLE Expenses (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Date DATE,
    Description NVARCHAR(255),
    Category NVARCHAR(100),
    Amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

---

#### 🧠 Tech Stack:
- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server (any edition)
- **Connector**: `pyodbc`
- **Environment**: CLI / Terminal (Optional: Extend to Flask or Streamlit for UI later)

---

#### 🚀 Stretch Goals (Optional, if you're feelin' spicy):
- Export expenses to a `.csv` file
- Add category filters or monthly summaries
- Visualize expenses using `matplotlib` or `pandas`
- Add authentication for multiple users
- Receipt image upload + OCR (👀 future vision!)

Want me to code this whole thing out or turn it into a full-blown project repo with requirements.txt, README, and all the corporate bells and whistles? Just say the word. 😎
