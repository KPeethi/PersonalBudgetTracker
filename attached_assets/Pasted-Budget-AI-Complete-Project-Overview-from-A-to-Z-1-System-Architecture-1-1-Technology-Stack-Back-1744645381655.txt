Budget AI: Complete Project Overview from A to Z
1. System Architecture
1.1 Technology Stack
Backend: Python/Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM
Database: PostgreSQL (default), with support for SQL Server and MySQL
Authentication: Flask-Login
Data Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib
External APIs: Plaid (financial data), OpenAI/Perplexity (AI analysis)
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
1.2 Database Schema
Users table: Stores user information and authentication data
Expenses table: Core table for expense entries with categories
Business_Users table: Links users to business accounts
Categories table: Pre-defined and custom expense categories
Receipts table: Stores uploaded receipt images and metadata
Excel_Imports table: Tracks imported data from Excel files
Notifications table: User-specific alerts and notifications
Budget_Limits table: User-defined spending limits by category
2. User Authentication System
2.1 Registration Process
Users register with username, email, and password
Email validation checks for valid format and detects potentially fake emails
Password requirements: 8+ characters, upper/lowercase, numbers, special character
Users are created with regular user status by default
User data is stored in Users table with hashed passwords
2.2 Login Process
Users provide email and password
System validates credentials against database records
Upon successful login, Flask-Login creates a user session
Failed login attempts are logged and limited
"Remember me" option extends session duration
2.3 Password Recovery
Users enter their email address
System sends a password reset link to the email
Reset link contains a time-limited secure token
Users set a new password, which is hashed and updated
